# Contributor Contributing Agreement

## Our Stance

"Nvy.io" and "NiKole Maxwell" and all other such entities represented by this Agreement, agree to speak in plain language, provide clarity, visibility and support to our coding friends, customers and clientele.  We want your participation with us, to be helpful.

## Our Standards

* Use clear lingo...if its clear as mud just add water
* We're all working towards a goal, create great usable content that can be nvy'd...with that in mind, create contributions only after stepping into the mind of the Creator.

If  you feel the need to step outside of the realm of common decency, please do not mind when your needs are assessed as lower than those of the project and project community and we put you back on the correct path.
